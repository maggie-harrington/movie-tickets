# Movie Tickets

#### _A movie ticket pricing page, 1/24/2017_

_I built this project to practice objects, constructors, and prototypes. This is a sample webpage that allows the user to determine the cost of a movie ticket based on several factors, including the title of the movie (new release vs. regular), the time of day the movie will be shown, and the user's age._
